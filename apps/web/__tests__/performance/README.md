# Authentication Performance and Security Testing Suite

This directory contains comprehensive performance and security testing for the authentication system, implementing Task 10.4 from the authentication user management specification.

## Overview

The testing suite covers four critical areas:
1. **Load Testing** - Authentication endpoint performance under load
2. **Security Testing** - Penetration testing for authentication vulnerabilities
3. **Accessibility Testing** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verification
4. **Mobile Performance** - Mobile-specific optimizations and performance

## Requirements Coverage

- **Requirement 7.1**: Session Management performance testing
- **Requirement 8.4**: Security vulnerability assessment
- **Requirement 9.1**: Accessibility compliance verification
- **Requirement 9.2**: User experience optimization validation

## Test Files

### 1. Load Testing (`auth-load-tests.test.ts`)
Tests authentication endpoints under various load conditions:
- Concurrent sign-in requests (50 users)
- Sustained load testing (5 batches of 20 requests)
- Sign-up load testing (30 concurrent registrations)
- Token refresh performance (100 concurrent refreshes)
- Mixed operation load testing
- Memory usage monitoring
- Error rate validation

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- Concurrent requests: < 5 seconds total
- Average response time: < 200ms
- Memory increase: < 50MB

- Mobile accessibility features
- Error handling accessibility

**Accessibility Standards:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

- Mobile accessibility support
- Assistive technology compatibility

### 4. Mobile Performance Testing (`mobile-performance-tests.test.ts`)
Mobile-specific performance optimizations:
- Mobile rendering performance
- Touch interaction responsiveness
- Responsive layout testing
- Network performance optimization
- Memory management on mobile
- Battery and CPU optimization
- Accessibility performance on mobile

**Mobile Benchmarks:**
- Render time: < 100ms
- Touch response: < 200ms
- Memory usage: < 50MB
- Bundle size: < 75KB

## Test Runner

The comprehensive test runner (`run-performance-security-tests.ts`) executes all test suites and generates detailed reports:

```bash
# Run all performance and security tests
pnpm test:performance-security

# Run individual test suites
pnpm test:load          # Load testing only
pnpm test:security      # Security testing only
pnpm test:accessibility # Accessibility testing only
pnpm test:mobile        # Mobile performance only
```

## Generated Reports

The test runner generates comprehensive reports in `test-reports/performance-security/`:

1. **comprehensive-report.md** - Executive summary and overall results
2. **security-report.md** - Detailed security assessment
3. **accessibility-report.md** - WCAG compliance report
4. **mobile-performance-report.md** - Mobile optimization metrics
5. **test-results.json** - Machine-readable results for CI/CD

## Performance Benchmarks

- **Interactive**: < 200ms
- **Bundle Size**: < 75KB
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB
- **Touch Response**: < 100ms

## CI/CD Integration

The test suite is designed for CI/CD integration:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions integration
- name: Run Performance and Security Tests
  run: pnpm test:performance-security
  env:
    NODE_OPTIONS: "--max-old-space-size=8192"

- name: Upload Test Reports
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: performance-security-reports
    path: test-reports/performance-security/
```

## Memory Management

All tests use proper memory allocation:
- Standard tests: 8GB heap size
- Coverage tests: 16GB heap size
- Parallel execution with fork isolation
- Garbage collection optimization

## Mock Strategy

### What We Mock
- External API responses (for consistent testing)
- Network delays (for performance simulation)
- Device characteristics (for mobile testing)
- Browser APIs (for accessibility testing)

### What We Don't Mock
- Authentication logic (tested with real flows)
- Security validations (tested with real attacks)
- Performance characteristics (measured with real metrics)
- Accessibility features (tested with real screen readers)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Memory Errors**
   - Ensure NODE_OPTIONS includes sufficient heap size
   - Use fork isolation for parallel tests
   - Enable garbage collection between test suites

2. **Test Timeouts**
   - Load tests may take up to 2 minutes
   - Security tests may take up to 3 minutes
   - Increase timeout values if needed

3. **Accessibility Test Failures**
   - Ensure jest-axe is properly installed
   - Check for proper ARIA attributes
   - Verify semantic HTML structure

4. **Mobile Test Issues**
   - Verify viewport simulation is working
   - Check touch event simulation
   - Ensure responsive CSS is loaded

### Performance Debugging

```bash
# Run with detailed performance logging
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192" pnpm test:load --reporter=verbose

# Profile memory usage
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192 --expose-gc" pnpm test:mobile

# Debug accessibility issues
pnpm test:accessibility --reporter=verbose
```

## Best Practices

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test suite runs independently
2. **Real Scenarios**: Tests simulate actual user behavior
3. **Performance Budgets**: Clear benchmarks for all metrics
4. **Security First**: Comprehensive vulnerability coverage
5. **Accessibility Focus**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance mandatory
6. **Mobile Optimization**: Performance targets for mobile devices

## Maintenance

- **Weekly**: Review performance benchmarks
- **Monthly**: Update security test vectors
- **Quarterly**: Accessibility compliance audit
- **As Needed**: Mobile performance optimization
