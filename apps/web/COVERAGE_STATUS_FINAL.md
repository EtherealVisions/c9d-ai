# Coverage Status Final Report

## Executive Summary

**Current Test Status**: INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES BLOCKING COVERAGE
- **Test Files**: 127 total (61 failed, 66 passed)
- **Test Cases**: 2,164 total (505 failed, 1,659 passed)
- **Success Rate**: ~77% (Below 85% target)

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Module Resolution Failures
- `Cannot find module '@/lib/database'` errors
- Import path resolution issues
- Missing database module implementation

### 2. Mock Infrastructure Problems
- Supabase mock chaining failures
- Inconsistent mock patterns across tests
- Service layer tests failing due to mock setup

### 3. Coverage Gaps by Priority

#### Critical (100% Required)
- Authentication components: ~60% current
- Auth services: ~50% current
- Security middleware: ~80% current

#### Important (90% Required)  
- Service layer: ~65% current
- API routes: ~75% current
- Database operations: ~70% current

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Fix Infrastructure (Priority 1)
```bash
# Create missing database module
mkdir -p lib/database
echo "export const createSupabaseClient = () => ({})" > lib/database/index.ts

# Update vitest config for path resolution
# Fix import aliases in vitest.config.ts
```

### 2. Repair Critical Tests (Priority 2)
- Fix authentication module tests
- Repair service layer mock infrastructure
- Complete error handling coverage

### 3. Achieve Coverage Targets (Priority 3)
- Authentication: 100% coverage
- Services: 90% coverage
- Overall: 85% minimum

## Estimated Timeline

**Week 1**: Infrastructure repair and critical coverage
**Week 2**: Coverage validation and optimization

## Success Criteria

- All tests passing (95%+ success rate)
- Coverage targets met per module
- Build and TypeScript compilation successful
- No module resolution errors

## Conclusion

The test infrastructure needs immediate repair before meaningful coverage improvements can be achieved. Focus on fixing module resolution and mock patterns first, then systematically build coverage.
