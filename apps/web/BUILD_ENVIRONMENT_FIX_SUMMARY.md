# Build Environment Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Environment Variables Not Available**: Vercel build environment variables are not accessible during the build process
2. **Edge Runtime Compatibility**: Config package uses Node.js APIs that aren't supported in Edge Runtime
3. **Build-Time Configuration Loading**: Application tries to load Phase.dev configuration during build
4. **Missing Error Exports**: Several error classes were missing from the custom-errors export

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Environment Variable Management
- Created `.env.build` with build-safe default values
- Updated `turbo.json` to include all required environment variables
- Migrated to `env-wrapper` CLI tool for environment management

### 2. Build-Safe Configuration
- Updated config package index to provide build-time stubs
- Modified config manager to detect build environment and use stubs
- Fixed layout.tsx to handle build-time configuration gracefully
- Added build-safe database client that uses mock values during build

### 3. API Route Safety
- Added build-time checks to all API routes that use configuration
- Routes return 503 status during build instead of crashing

### 4. Error Class Exports
- Added all missing error classes to custom-errors.ts
- Fixed export/import issues in error handling

## Current Status

The build process now:
- ✅ Loads build-safe environment variables
- ✅ Uses stubs for Phase.dev configuration during build
- ✅ Handles Edge Runtime compatibility issues
- ✅ Provides proper error classes
- ⚠️ Still has some property access issues in layout.tsx

## Next Steps

The remaining issue is that the layout.tsx is trying to access properties that don't exist in the build-time stubs. This needs to be fixed by ensuring all expected properties are present in the stubs.
