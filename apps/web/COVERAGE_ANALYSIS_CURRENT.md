# Coverage Analysis Report

## Current Status

Based on the test execution, there are significant test failures that need to be addressed before accurate coverage analysis can be performed. The main issues are:

### Critical Test Failures

1. **Authentication Middleware Issues**: The users API tests are failing due to authentication middleware mocking problems
2. **Database Service Mocking**: Many service tests are failing due to improper Supabase client mocking
3. **Path Engine Tests**: Multiple failures in path generation and adaptation logic
4. **Progress Tracker Service**: Extensive failures in progress tracking functionality

### Test Failure Categories

#### 1. Authentication & Authorization (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Files Affected**: `__tests__/api/users.api.test.ts`, auth middleware tests
- **Issues**: 
  - `NextResponse.next is not a function` errors
  - Clerk authentication mocking failures
  - User authentication state not properly mocked
- **Impact**: Critical API routes cannot be tested

#### 2. Database Service Layer (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Files Affected**: All service tests (`progress-tracker-service.test.ts`, `path-engine.test.ts`, etc.)
- **Issues**:
  - Supabase client mocking structure incorrect
  - Database query chain mocking failures
  - Service method calls throwing `DatabaseError` instead of expected behavior
- **Impact**: Core business logic cannot be validated

#### 3. Component Integration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Files Affected**: Organization context tests, onboarding component tests
- **Issues**:
  - Context provider state management
  - Hook integration failures
  - Component rendering with mocked services
- **Impact**: UI functionality validation compromised

#### 4. Error Handling (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Files Affected**: Error handling integration tests, error utils tests
- **Issues**:
  - Console logging expectations not met
  - Error response format mismatches
  - Error propagation chain broken
- **Impact**: Error scenarios not properly tested

## Coverage Estimation

Based on the file structure and test patterns, estimated coverage by module:

### Critical Business Logic (Target: 100%)
- **Services (`lib/services/**`)**: ~30% (due to test failures)
  - `progress-tracker-service.ts`: 0% (all tests failing)
  - `path-engine.ts`: 0% (all tests failing)
  - `onboarding-service.ts`: ~20% (partial test success)
  - `organization-onboarding-service.ts`: ~15% (most tests failing)

### Data Layer (Target: 95%)
- **Models (`lib/models/**`)**: ~60% (schema validation issues)
- **Database utilities**: ~40% (mocking problems)

### API Routes (Target: 90%)
- **API Routes (`app/api/**`)**: ~10% (authentication failures)
  - `users/route.ts`: 0% (all tests failing)
  - Other API routes: Not tested due to similar issues

### Components (Target: 85%)
- **React Components**: ~70% (mixed success)
  - Onboarding components: ~80% (better test coverage)
  - Organization components: ~60% (context issues)
  - UI components: ~85% (simpler, more stable tests)

## Immediate Action Items

### 1. Fix Authentication Mocking (URGENT)
```typescript
// Fix the auth middleware mocking in tests
vi.mock('@clerk/nextjs/server', () => ({
  auth: vi.fn(() => ({ userId: 'test-user-id' })),
  currentUser: vi.fn()
}))

// Fix NextResponse mocking
vi.mock('next/server', () => ({
  NextRequest: vi.fn(),
  NextResponse: {
    json: vi.fn((data, init) => ({ 
      json: () => Promise.resolve(data),
      status: init?.status || 200 
    })),
    next: vi.fn(() => ({ status: 200 }))
  }
}))
```

### 2. Fix Database Service Mocking (URGENT)
```typescript
// Create proper Supabase client mock structure
const createMockSupabaseClient = () => {
  const mockQuery = {
    select: vi.fn().mockReturnThis(),
    insert: vi.fn().mockReturnThis(),
    update: vi.fn().mockReturnThis(),
    eq: vi.fn().mockReturnThis(),
    order: vi.fn().mockReturnThis(),
    single: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ data: null, error: null })
  }
  
  return {
    from: vi.fn(() => mockQuery)
  }
}
```

### 3. Update Test Expectations (HIGH)
- Fix error message expectations to match actual implementation
- Update response format expectations
- Align test assertions with current API contracts

### 4. Implement Missing Tests (MEDIUM)
- Add comprehensive API route tests
- Expand service layer test coverage
- Add integration tests for critical workflows

## Coverage Targets by Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Infrastructure (Week 1)
- **Target**: 85% overall coverage
- **Focus**: Authentication, core services, API routes
- **Success Criteria**: All authentication and database tests passing

### Phase 2: Business Logic (Week 2)
- **Target**: 90% overall coverage
- **Focus**: Onboarding flows, organization management
- **Success Criteria**: All service layer tests passing with proper mocking

### Phase 3: Integration & E2E (Week 3)
- **Target**: 95% overall coverage
- **Focus**: Component integration, user workflows
- **Success Criteria**: Full user journey tests passing

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Stop development until test infrastructure is fixed
2. **Short-term**: Implement proper mocking patterns across all test files
3. **Medium-term**: Add comprehensive integration tests
4. **Long-term**: Implement automated coverage reporting and enforcement

## Test Infrastructure Improvements Needed

1. **Standardized Mocking**: Create reusable mock factories
2. **Test Utilities**: Build common test setup and teardown utilities
3. **Coverage Enforcement**: Implement pre-commit hooks for coverage validation
4. **CI Integration**: Add coverage reporting to CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion

The current test suite has significant infrastructure issues that prevent accurate coverage measurement. The estimated overall coverage is approximately **35-40%**, which is well below the required thresholds. Immediate action is required to fix the test infrastructure before proceeding with feature development.

**CRITICAL**: No code should be merged until test coverage reaches minimum thresholds:
- Services: 100%
- Models: 95% 
- API Routes: 90%
- Overall: 85%
