# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Agent Management via UI feature provides an intuitive, web-based interface for creating, configuring, and managing AI agents within the C9d.ai platform. This system enables users to perform all agent lifecycle operations through a visual interface, including agent creation, configuration, execution monitoring, and collaboration. The UI integrates with the existing Agent Management via API system to provide a seamless experience for both technical and non-technical users, with role-based access controls and organizational context awareness.

3. WHEN filtering agents THEN the system SHALL support filtering by status, persona, creation date, last execution, and custom tags
4. WHEN sorting agents THEN the system SHALL allow sorting by name, creation date, last modified, execution frequency, and performance metrics
5. IF no agents match criteria THEN the system SHALL provide helpful suggestions and quick actions to create relevant agents

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to execute agents directly from the UI and monitor their progress in real-time, so that I can test functionality and track execution without using external tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing an agent THEN the system SHALL provide an input form based on the agent's input schema with validation
2. WHEN agent execution starts THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress indicators and status updates
3. WHEN execution completes THEN the system SHALL show formatted results with options to download, share, or use as input for other agents
4. WHEN monitoring executions THEN the system SHALL provide live logs and performance metrics during agent runtime
5. IF execution fails THEN the system SHALL display detailed error information with troubleshooting suggestions and retry options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view comprehensive execution history and analytics for my agents, so that I can understand performance patterns and optimize agent configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing execution history THEN the system SHALL display chronological execution logs with inputs, outputs, and performance metrics
2. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL provide charts and graphs showing success rates, execution times, and usage patterns
3. WHEN comparing executions THEN the system SHALL allow side-by-side comparison of different execution results and configurations
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support downloading execution history and analytics in multiple formats
5. IF performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight problems and suggest optimization recommendations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to collaborate on agent development with sharing, commenting, and version control features, so that my team can work together effectively on agent projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sharing agents THEN the system SHALL provide granular sharing controls with view, edit, and execute permissions
2. WHEN collaborating on agents THEN the system SHALL support comments, annotations, and discussion threads on agent configurations
3. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL maintain version history with diff views and rollback capabilities
4. WHEN working in teams THEN the system SHALL show who is currently editing agents and prevent conflicting modifications
5. IF collaboration conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL provide merge conflict resolution tools and notification systems

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage agent chains through a visual workflow builder, so that I can design complex multi-step processes without writing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building agent chains THEN the system SHALL provide a drag-and-drop workflow designer with visual connections between agents
2. WHEN configuring data flow THEN the system SHALL offer visual mapping tools for connecting outputs to inputs between chained agents
3. WHEN testing chains THEN the system SHALL support step-by-step execution with intermediate result inspection
4. WHEN managing complex workflows THEN the system SHALL provide conditional logic, branching, and error handling configuration
5. IF chain validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight incompatible connections and suggest corrections

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an organization administrator, I want to manage team access to agents and monitor usage across my organization, so that I can ensure proper governance and resource allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing team access THEN the system SHALL provide role-based permissions for agent creation, modification, and execution
2. WHEN monitoring usage THEN the system SHALL display organization-wide agent usage statistics and resource consumption
3. WHEN setting policies THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of agent creation limits, execution quotas, and approval workflows
4. WHEN reviewing activity THEN the system SHALL provide audit logs of all agent operations with user attribution and timestamps
5. IF policy violations occur THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and provide enforcement options

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to duplicate, template, and share agent configurations, so that I can quickly create similar agents and share best practices with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicating agents THEN the system SHALL create exact copies with options to modify names and configurations before saving
2. WHEN creating templates THEN the system SHALL allow saving agent configurations as reusable templates with parameter placeholders
3. WHEN using templates THEN the system SHALL provide a template gallery with search, filtering, and preview capabilities
4. WHEN sharing configurations THEN the system SHALL support exporting and importing agent configurations across organizations
5. IF template parameters are missing THEN the system SHALL prompt for required values and validate configuration completeness

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want integrated help and documentation within the agent management interface, so that I can learn features and troubleshoot issues without leaving the application.
