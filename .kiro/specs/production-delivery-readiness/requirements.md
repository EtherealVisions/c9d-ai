# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for enabling production delivery of the C9D AI platform application. The goal is to ensure that all development and build commands work without exceptions, allowing the product to be rendered in full for delivery. This includes fixing immediate build failures, ensuring proper environment configuration, validating all test suites, and establishing robust CI/CD processes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Build System Integrity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all build commands to execute successfully so that the application can be compiled and deployed without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `pnpm typecheck` THEN the system SHALL complete with zero TypeScript compilation errors
2. WHEN running `pnpm build` THEN the system SHALL successfully build all packages and applications
3. WHEN running `pnpm dev` THEN the system SHALL start the development server without errors
4. IF there are missing type definitions THEN the system SHALL provide proper type imports and configurations
5. WHEN building packages THEN the system SHALL respect dependency order and complete all builds successfully

### Requirement 2: Test Suite Stability

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want all test suites to run successfully so that I can validate application functionality before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `pnpm test` THEN the system SHALL execute all tests and exit gracefully without manual intervention
2. WHEN running `pnpm test:coverage` THEN the system SHALL generate coverage reports meeting minimum thresholds
3. WHEN tests encounter missing dependencies THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and resolution paths
4. IF test configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL include proper vitest setup and configuration files
5. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL properly handle environment variables and external dependencies

### Requirement 3: Environment Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want environment variables to be properly managed across all environments so that the application can run consistently in development, staging, and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load environment variables from the appropriate sources (phase.dev, .env files)
2. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating required variables
3. WHEN running in different environments THEN the system SHALL use the correct configuration for each environment
4. IF phase.dev integration fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to local environment files
5. WHEN validating environment setup THEN the system SHALL verify all required variables are present and valid

### Requirement 4: Package Dependencies Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all package dependencies to be properly resolved so that imports work correctly across the monorepo.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing from workspace packages THEN the system SHALL resolve all internal package references correctly
2. WHEN building packages THEN the system SHALL respect the proper build order based on dependencies
3. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL support hot reloading across package boundaries
4. IF package versions conflict THEN the system SHALL use consistent versions across the workspace
5. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use pnpm workspaces correctly

### Requirement 5: Production Deployment Readiness

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want the application to be ready for production deployment so that users can access the full functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL build successfully with all optimizations enabled
2. WHEN running production builds THEN the system SHALL generate optimized bundles with proper code splitting
3. WHEN validating production readiness THEN the system SHALL pass all quality gates (tests, linting, type checking)
4. IF deployment validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reports and remediation steps
5. WHEN the application runs in production THEN the system SHALL handle all user flows without errors

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and diagnostics so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN build errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
2. WHEN runtime errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL indicate specific files and line numbers causing issues
4. IF configuration is incorrect THEN the system SHALL suggest proper configuration values
5. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic commands and health checks

### Requirement 7: Performance and Optimization

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the application to load quickly and perform efficiently so that I have a smooth experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL achieve Core Web Vitals targets (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1)
2. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL optimize bundle sizes and enable proper caching
3. WHEN running development builds THEN the system SHALL provide fast rebuild times and hot reloading
4. IF performance regressions occur THEN the system SHALL detect and report them during CI/CD
5. WHEN serving static assets THEN the system SHALL use appropriate compression and caching headers

### Requirement 8: Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want the application to meet security standards so that user data is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling user authentication THEN the system SHALL use secure authentication flows with Clerk
2. WHEN accessing databases THEN the system SHALL enforce Row Level Security policies
3. WHEN validating inputs THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate all user inputs
4. IF security vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and require fixes
5. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL use proper encryption and secure storage

### Requirement 9: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a site reliability engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging so that I can maintain system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log structured error information
3. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide metrics and alerts
4. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL monitor and report resource usage
5. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs and tracing information

### Requirement 10: Documentation and Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a new developer, I want comprehensive documentation and tooling so that I can quickly contribute to the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup instructions
2. WHEN running commands THEN the system SHALL provide helpful CLI output and progress indicators
3. WHEN encountering errors THEN the system SHALL link to relevant documentation and troubleshooting guides
4. IF configuration changes are needed THEN the system SHALL document all configuration options
5. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN the system SHALL provide automated setup scripts and validation
