# Production Delivery Readiness Design Document

## Overview

This design document defines a comprehensive approach to enable production delivery of the C9D AI platform with exceptional quality standards. The primary goals are to fix build failures, achieve exceptional test coverage with robust methodology, and deliver production-ready code that meets the highest quality expectations. We'll leverage existing Phase Service and Config Module while establishing rigorous quality gates and continuous validation processes.

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Immediate Fix Components

#### TypeScript Error Resolution
```typescript
// Fix missing vitest types in packages/config
interface TestSetup {
  globals: boolean
  environment: 'jsdom' | 'node'
  setupFiles: string[]
}

// Ensure proper type imports
interface TypeImports {
  vitest: ['describe', 'it', 'expect', 'beforeAll', 'afterAll', 'vi']
  testingLibrary: ['render', 'screen', 'fireEvent', 'waitFor']
}
```

#### Build Validation (Minimal)
```typescript
interface BuildStatus {
  typecheck: boolean
  packages: Record<string, boolean>
  errors: string[]
}

interface QuickValidator {
  checkTypeScript(): Promise<boolean>
  checkPackageBuilds(): Promise<boolean>
  reportErrors(): string[]
}
```

### 2. Existing Infrastructure (Utilize, Don't Rebuild)

#### Phase Service Integration (Already Exists)
- Use existing Phase Service for environment loading
- Leverage existing Config Module for configuration management
- Maintain existing phase.dev integration patterns

#### Test Infrastructure (Fix, Don't Replace)
- Fix vitest configuration in packages/config
- Ensure test types are properly imported
- Maintain existing test patterns and structure

## Data Models

### Build Error Model (Simplified)
```typescript
interface BuildError {
  package: string
  file: string
  line?: number
  message: string
  suggestion?: string
}

interface BuildResult {
  success: boolean
  errors: BuildError[]
  warnings: string[]
}
```

## Error Handling

### Immediate Error Resolution Strategy

### Error Recovery Process
```typescript
interface ErrorRecovery {

  suggestFix(error: BuildError): string
  applyFix(error: BuildError): Promise<boolean>
}
```

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: 'node',
    setupFiles: ['./vitest.setup.ts'],
    // Parallel execution configuration
    pool: 'threads',
    poolOptions: {
      threads: {
        singleThread: false,
        maxThreads: 4,
        minThreads: 1
      }
    },
    // Coverage thresholds for exceptional standards
    coverage: {
      provider: 'v8',
      thresholds: {
        global: {
          branches: 85,
          functions: 85,
          lines: 85,
          statements: 85
        },
        // Exceptional standards by path
        'lib/services/**': {
          branches: 100,
          functions: 100,
          lines: 100,
          statements: 100
        },
        'lib/models/**': {
          branches: 95,
          functions: 95,
          lines: 95,
          statements: 95
        },
        'app/api/**': {
          branches: 90,
          functions: 90,
          lines: 90,
          statements: 90
        }
      }
    }
  }
})

// vitest.setup.ts (Enhanced Setup)
import { vi } from 'vitest'
import { setupTestDatabase } from './test-database'
import { setupAuthenticationCache } from './auth-cache'

// Global test setup with proper isolation
beforeEach(async () => {
  await setupTestDatabase()
  await setupAuthenticationCache()
})

afterEach(async () => {
  await cleanupTestDatabase()
  vi.clearAllMocks()
})
```

// Service Layer Testing with Real Dependencies
interface ServiceTestConfig {
  useRealDatabase: boolean
  useRealAuthentication: boolean
  enableCaching: boolean
  validateSchema: boolean
}

// API Integration Testing with Real Endpoints
interface APITestConfig {
  testEndpoints: string[]
