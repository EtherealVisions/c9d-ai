# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the need for robust Phase.dev configuration management using the official Phase.dev Node.js SDK (https://docs.phase.dev/sdks/node). The current implementation uses a custom API integration that doesn't follow Phase.dev's official SDK patterns, causing 404 errors even when the Phase.dev app exists. The system should migrate to use the official Phase.dev Node.js SDK, provide clear error messages, automatic fallback mechanisms, and proper development workflow support.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to use the official Phase.dev Node.js SDK for environment variable management, so that I have reliable and supported integration with Phase.dev services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing Phase.dev integration THEN the system SHALL use the official Phase.dev Node.js SDK instead of custom API calls
2. WHEN Phase.dev SDK returns an error THEN the system SHALL log a clear error message and fall back to local environment variables
3. WHEN Phase.dev service token is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on how to fix the token using SDK error messages
4. WHEN Phase.dev app does not exist THEN the system SHALL provide instructions on creating the required app and environment
5. WHEN Phase.dev is completely unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue loading with local environment variables only
6. IF local environment variables are missing critical keys THEN the system SHALL display a configuration checklist with specific missing variables

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN loading from multiple sources, so that Phase.dev SDK can initialize regardless of how the token is provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN THEN the system SHALL check process.env first for the token
2. WHEN process.env token is not available THEN the system SHALL check local .env.* files in the current directory
3. WHEN local .env.* files don't contain the token THEN the system SHALL check root .env.* files in the workspace root
4. WHEN token is found in any source THEN the system SHALL use it to initialize the Phase.dev SDK
5. IF no PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN is found in any source THEN the system SHALL log a clear error and fall back to local environment variables only
6. WHEN multiple .env files contain the token THEN the system SHALL use the precedence order: process.env > local .env.local > local .env > root .env.local > root .env

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Phase.dev SDK initialization and configuration management, so that environment variables are loaded efficiently and securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the Phase.dev SDK THEN the system SHALL use proper authentication with service tokens loaded from multiple sources
2. WHEN fetching environment variables THEN the system SHALL use the SDK's built-in methods for retrieving secrets
3. WHEN caching environment variables THEN the system SHALL respect Phase.dev SDK's caching mechanisms and TTL settings
4. WHEN environment variables change in Phase.dev THEN the system SHALL detect changes and refresh the cache appropriately
5. IF Phase.dev SDK initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms for Phase.dev SDK integration, so that development workflow is never blocked by Phase.dev issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Phase.dev SDK throws authentication errors THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on service token configuration and where to place the token
2. WHEN Phase.dev SDK throws network errors THEN the system SHALL fall back to local environment variables and log the network issue
3. WHEN Phase.dev SDK throws app/environment not found errors THEN the system SHALL provide instructions for creating the missing resources
4. WHEN Phase.dev SDK is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue with local environment variables and display a warning
5. IF critical environment variables are missing from both Phase.dev and local files THEN the system SHALL display a configuration checklist

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Phase.dev SDK integration with TypeScript support, so that I have type safety and better development experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Phase.dev SDK THEN the system SHALL have proper TypeScript type definitions for all SDK methods
2. WHEN fetching secrets THEN the system SHALL use typed interfaces for secret data structures
3. WHEN handling SDK responses THEN the system SHALL use proper error typing and response validation
4. WHEN configuring SDK options THEN the system SHALL use typed configuration objects with validation
5. IF SDK methods change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility through proper versioning

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a team member, I want standardized Phase.dev SDK usage patterns across the application, so that all team members can work with consistent configuration management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating Phase.dev SDK THEN the system SHALL follow Phase.dev's official documentation and best practices
2. WHEN handling secrets THEN the system SHALL use the SDK's recommended patterns for secret retrieval and caching
3. WHEN configuring environments THEN the system SHALL use the standard Phase.dev environment naming conventions
4. WHEN implementing error handling THEN the system SHALL use the SDK's built-in error types and handling patterns
5. IF SDK usage patterns change THEN the system SHALL update all integrations to maintain consistency

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless migration from custom Phase.dev API integration to the official SDK, so that existing functionality continues to work without breaking changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating to Phase.dev SDK THEN the system SHALL maintain the same public interface for environment variable loading
2. WHEN replacing custom API calls THEN the system SHALL ensure all existing functionality continues to work
3. WHEN updating dependencies THEN the system SHALL add the official Phase.dev Node.js SDK package
4. WHEN removing custom API code THEN the system SHALL replace it with equivalent SDK method calls
5. IF migration introduces breaking changes THEN the system SHALL provide backward compatibility adapters
