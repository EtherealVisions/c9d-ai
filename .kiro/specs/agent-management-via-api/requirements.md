# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Agent Management via API feature provides comprehensive programmatic access to create, configure, and manage AI agents through REST API endpoints. This system enables developers to build custom workflows, automate agent deployment, and integrate agent capabilities into external applications. The API supports full agent lifecycle management including creation, configuration, execution monitoring, and versioning, with proper authentication, authorization, and audit logging integrated with the existing token management and organizational systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create new agents programmatically via REST API, so that I can automate agent deployment and integrate agent creation into my development workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an agent via API THEN the system SHALL accept agent configuration including name, description, persona, and trigger settings
2. WHEN agent creation is successful THEN the system SHALL return the created agent with unique identifier and configuration details
3. WHEN agent creation fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed error messages with validation feedback
4. WHEN creating agents THEN the system SHALL validate API token permissions for agent creation scope
5. IF organizational limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL reject creation with quota information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure agent input/output schemas and trigger modes, so that I can define how agents process data and when they execute.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring agent schemas THEN the system SHALL support JSON Schema definitions for input and output validation
2. WHEN setting trigger modes THEN the system SHALL support event-based, manual, and scheduled execution triggers
3. WHEN configuring agent behavior THEN the system SHALL allow assignment of personas, skillsets, and execution parameters
4. WHEN updating agent configuration THEN the system SHALL validate schema compatibility and trigger mode settings
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL return specific validation errors with correction guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want full CRUD operations on agent resources, so that I can manage the complete agent lifecycle through API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN retrieving agents THEN the system SHALL support GET operations with filtering, pagination, and sorting
2. WHEN updating agents THEN the system SHALL support PUT/PATCH operations with partial updates and validation
3. WHEN deleting agents THEN the system SHALL support DELETE operations with confirmation and dependency checking
4. WHEN listing agents THEN the system SHALL return agents visible to the current token's organizational context
5. IF agent operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error responses with operation-specific guidance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage agent chaining and composition, so that I can create complex workflows with multiple interconnected agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring agent chains THEN the system SHALL support linking agents with input/output mappings
2. WHEN creating agent compositions THEN the system SHALL validate compatibility between chained agents
3. WHEN executing agent chains THEN the system SHALL manage data flow and error handling between agents
4. WHEN monitoring chains THEN the system SHALL provide execution status and performance metrics for each step
5. IF chain execution fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure information and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want access to agent execution logs and performance metrics, so that I can monitor agent behavior and optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing execution logs THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs with timestamps, inputs, outputs, and execution duration
2. WHEN querying performance metrics THEN the system SHALL return success rates, average execution times, and error patterns
3. WHEN filtering logs THEN the system SHALL support date ranges, execution status, and agent-specific filtering
4. WHEN exporting logs THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats (JSON, CSV) for analysis and reporting
5. IF log access is restricted THEN the system SHALL enforce token-based permissions for log visibility

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want agent versioning and deployment management, so that I can maintain multiple agent versions and control deployments safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating agent versions THEN the system SHALL maintain version history with semantic versioning
2. WHEN deploying agents THEN the system SHALL support staging and production environment separation
3. WHEN rolling back agents THEN the system SHALL enable quick reversion to previous working versions
4. WHEN comparing versions THEN the system SHALL provide diff views of configuration changes
5. IF version conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL prevent overwrites and require explicit version management

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an organization administrator, I want to control agent visibility and access within my organization, so that I can manage team collaboration and resource sharing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assigning agent visibility THEN the system SHALL support team-level and organization-level access controls
2. WHEN managing agent permissions THEN the system SHALL integrate with organizational RBAC for fine-grained access
3. WHEN sharing agents THEN the system SHALL allow controlled sharing between teams and external organizations
4. WHEN auditing agent access THEN the system SHALL log all agent operations with user and token attribution
5. IF access violations occur THEN the system SHALL deny operations and log security events

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration with FRD documentation and context, so that agents can leverage project documentation and requirements for enhanced functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating agents THEN the system SHALL support integration with FRD-sourced context and documentation
2. WHEN configuring agent knowledge THEN the system SHALL allow attachment of Docusaurus documentation as context
3. WHEN executing agents THEN the system SHALL provide access to relevant project documentation and specifications
4. WHEN updating documentation THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh agent context with latest information
5. IF documentation access fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle missing context without agent failure

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API documentation and SDKs, so that I can easily integrate agent management into my applications and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing API documentation THEN the system SHALL provide complete OpenAPI specifications with examples
2. WHEN using SDKs THEN the system SHALL support JavaScript/TypeScript and Python client libraries
3. WHEN following examples THEN the system SHALL provide working code samples for common agent management tasks
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL document all error codes and provide troubleshooting guidance
5. IF API changes occur THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility and provide migration guides

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want agent resource monitoring and quota management, so that I can ensure system stability and fair resource allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring agent usage THEN the system SHALL track execution time, memory usage, and API calls per agent
2. WHEN enforcing quotas THEN the system SHALL limit agent executions based on subscription plan and organizational limits
3. WHEN detecting resource abuse THEN the system SHALL automatically throttle or suspend problematic agents
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide resource utilization analytics and cost attribution
5. IF resource limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL notify administrators and provide upgrade recommendations
