# Phase Environment Modernization Requirements

## Introduction

This feature modernizes our Phase.dev environment variable management by replacing the current custom `run-with-env.js` script with the proven `@coordinated/env-tools` and `@coordinated/phase-client` packages. These packages provide sophisticated environment management with proper TypeScript support, CLI tools, validation, and seamless integration with our pnpm/turbo monorepo architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Package Integration and Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new environment packages properly integrated into our monorepo so that I can use them across all apps and packages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine the root package.json THEN @coordinated/env-tools and @coordinated/phase-client SHALL be listed as workspace dependencies
2. WHEN I examine pnpm-workspace.yaml THEN both packages SHALL be included in the workspace configuration
3. WHEN I run pnpm install THEN both packages SHALL be built and available for use
4. WHEN I examine turbo.json THEN build dependencies SHALL be properly configured for the new packages
5. WHEN apps reference these packages THEN they SHALL resolve correctly through workspace protocol

### Requirement 2: CLI Tool Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CLI tools from env-tools to be available globally in the monorepo so that I can use them from any location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `pnpm env-wrapper` from any location THEN the CLI tool SHALL execute successfully
2. WHEN I run `pnpm validate-env` from any location THEN environment validation SHALL run
3. WHEN I run `pnpm vercel-phase-prebuild` from any location THEN Vercel prebuild integration SHALL work
4. WHEN the CLI tools execute THEN they SHALL have access to proper Phase.dev configuration
5. WHEN CLI tools fail THEN they SHALL provide clear error messages and suggestions

### Requirement 3: App Context Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each app and package to automatically use the correct Phase.dev context based on configuration so that environment variables are loaded from the right source.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an app has a `phase.appName` field in package.json THEN that SHALL be used as the Phase.dev context
2. WHEN a root-level configuration file exists THEN it SHALL map apps/packages to their Phase.dev contexts
3. WHEN no specific configuration exists THEN the system SHALL use intelligent defaults based on app names
4. WHEN multiple configuration sources exist THEN package.json SHALL take precedence over root configuration
5. WHEN context resolution fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4: Script Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing scripts that use `run-with-env.js` to be migrated to use the new environment tools so that I have consistent environment loading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I examine app package.json files THEN all scripts SHALL use the new env-wrapper instead of run-with-env.js
2. WHEN I run any script THEN environment variables SHALL be loaded using the new system
3. WHEN scripts execute THEN they SHALL maintain the same functionality as before
4. WHEN environment loading fails THEN scripts SHALL provide clear error messages
5. WHEN scripts run in CI/CD THEN they SHALL work correctly with Vercel and other deployment platforms

### Requirement 5: Turbo Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Turbo tasks to work seamlessly with the new environment system so that builds, tests, and other tasks have proper environment variables.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Turbo executes tasks THEN environment variables SHALL be loaded correctly
2. WHEN tasks depend on environment variables THEN they SHALL be available during execution
3. WHEN tasks run in parallel THEN environment loading SHALL not conflict
4. WHEN tasks cache THEN environment-dependent outputs SHALL be handled correctly
5. WHEN Turbo tasks fail due to environment issues THEN error messages SHALL be clear

### Requirement 6: Environment Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive environment validation so that I can catch configuration issues early in development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run validation commands THEN all required environment variables SHALL be checked
2. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN validation SHALL provide specific error messages
3. WHEN environment variables are invalid THEN validation SHALL suggest corrections
4. WHEN validation passes THEN I SHALL receive confirmation of successful configuration
5. WHEN validation runs in CI THEN it SHALL fail the build if environment is invalid

### Requirement 7: Development Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want excellent development experience with the new environment system so that I can work efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start development servers THEN environment variables SHALL load quickly and reliably
2. WHEN environment variables change THEN I SHALL receive notifications or automatic reloading
3. WHEN debugging environment issues THEN I SHALL have access to detailed logging and diagnostics
4. WHEN working offline THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to local environment files
5. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN setup SHALL be straightforward with clear documentation

### Requirement 8: Testing Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to work correctly with the new environment system so that I can run tests reliably in all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run tests THEN they SHALL have access to proper test environment variables
2. WHEN tests run in CI THEN environment loading SHALL not cause failures
3. WHEN tests run locally THEN they SHALL use appropriate test configurations
4. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL have access to real Phase.dev environments when needed
5. WHEN test environments are misconfigured THEN clear error messages SHALL be provided

### Requirement 9: Deployment Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want deployments to work seamlessly with the new environment system so that production deployments are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to Vercel THEN the prebuild integration SHALL load environment variables correctly
2. WHEN building for production THEN all required environment variables SHALL be available
3. WHEN deployment environments differ THEN the correct context SHALL be used automatically
4. WHEN deployment fails due to environment issues THEN error messages SHALL be actionable
5. WHEN deploying to different stages THEN appropriate environment contexts SHALL be used

### Requirement 10: Documentation and Training

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation for the new environment system so that I can use it effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to configure a new app THEN documentation SHALL provide clear instructions
2. WHEN I encounter issues THEN troubleshooting guides SHALL help resolve them
3. WHEN I need to understand the architecture THEN technical documentation SHALL be available
4. WHEN onboarding new team members THEN getting started guides SHALL be comprehensive
5. WHEN best practices are needed THEN guidelines SHALL be clearly documented

### Requirement 11: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new environment system to be fast and reliable so that it doesn't slow down development workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are loaded THEN the process SHALL complete within acceptable time limits
2. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL recover gracefully
3. WHEN Phase.dev is unavailable THEN fallback mechanisms SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN multiple processes load environments simultaneously THEN performance SHALL remain acceptable
5. WHEN monitoring the system THEN performance metrics SHALL be available
