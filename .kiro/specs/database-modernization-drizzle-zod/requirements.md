# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature modernizes the database layer by migrating from the current Supabase client-based approach to Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations and Zod for comprehensive schema validation. This will improve type safety, developer experience, performance, and maintainability while providing better error handling and validation throughout the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Drizzle ORM for database operations, so that I can benefit from type-safe queries, better performance, and improved developer experience with auto-completion and compile-time error detection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing database queries THEN the system SHALL use Drizzle ORM with full TypeScript type safety
2. WHEN defining database schemas THEN the system SHALL use Drizzle schema definitions that generate accurate TypeScript types
3. WHEN executing queries THEN the system SHALL provide compile-time validation of query structure and parameters
4. WHEN database schema changes THEN the system SHALL automatically update TypeScript types through Drizzle introspection
5. IF query syntax is incorrect THEN the system SHALL provide compile-time errors with clear error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Zod for schema validation, so that I can ensure data integrity with runtime validation, clear error messages, and seamless integration with TypeScript types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating input data THEN the system SHALL use Zod schemas for comprehensive runtime validation
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed, user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN defining API contracts THEN the system SHALL use Zod schemas that automatically generate TypeScript types
4. WHEN transforming data THEN the system SHALL use Zod's parsing and transformation capabilities
5. IF validation rules change THEN the system SHALL maintain type safety between runtime validation and TypeScript types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration between Drizzle and Zod, so that I can maintain consistency between database schemas and validation schemas while avoiding code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining database models THEN the system SHALL generate corresponding Zod schemas automatically
2. WHEN database schemas change THEN the system SHALL update validation schemas accordingly
3. WHEN performing CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL validate data using Zod before database operations
4. WHEN handling API requests THEN the system SHALL use unified schemas for both validation and database operations
5. IF schema definitions conflict THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and resolution guidance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved error handling and debugging, so that I can quickly identify and resolve database and validation issues with clear error messages and proper error types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide structured error objects with clear error codes and messages
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide field-specific error messages with context
3. WHEN debugging queries THEN the system SHALL provide query logging and performance metrics
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL maintain error type safety throughout the application
5. IF errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide sufficient context for debugging and resolution

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want migration support and backward compatibility, so that I can gradually migrate from the current Supabase approach to Drizzle/Zod without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating services THEN the system SHALL support both old and new database approaches during transition
2. WHEN existing code uses legacy models THEN the system SHALL continue to function without modification
3. WHEN new features are developed THEN the system SHALL use the new Drizzle/Zod approach
4. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL remove legacy code and dependencies
5. IF migration issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities and clear migration guides

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance optimization and caching, so that I can benefit from Drizzle's query optimization and implement efficient caching strategies for database operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing queries THEN the system SHALL use Drizzle's optimized query generation and execution
2. WHEN performing complex queries THEN the system SHALL leverage Drizzle's query builder for optimal SQL generation
3. WHEN caching is appropriate THEN the system SHALL implement query result caching with proper invalidation
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL provide query performance metrics and logging
5. IF performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide query analysis and optimization recommendations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing support, so that I can test database operations and validation logic with proper mocking, fixtures, and integration testing capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing unit tests THEN the system SHALL provide Drizzle-compatible mocking utilities
2. WHEN testing validation THEN the system SHALL support Zod schema testing with comprehensive test cases
3. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL support database seeding and cleanup with Drizzle
4. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL provide utilities for testing error handling paths
5. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information
