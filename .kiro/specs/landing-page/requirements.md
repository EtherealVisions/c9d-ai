# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Landing Page serves as the primary entry point and conversion funnel for C9d.ai, designed to communicate the platform's value proposition as a coordinated AI capabilities suite, build trust, and guide visitors toward meaningful engagement. The page showcases the five modular C9 Suite capabilities (Insight, Persona, Domain, Orchestrator, and Narrative) that can be consumed as services, APIs, or integrations. The page leverages the existing vibrant color palette (purple-pink gradients, electric blue, teal accents, and bright yellow-lime) with gentle floating animations to create a novel, approachable, yet sophisticated experience. The design emphasizes the platform's coordinated AI intelligence capabilities while maintaining accessibility and performance optimization for Vercel deployment.
