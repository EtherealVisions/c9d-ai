# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The C9 Suite Capability Pages feature creates dedicated solution-specific pages for each of the five C9 Suite capabilities: Insight, Persona, Domain, Orchestrator, and Narrative. These pages serve as detailed product showcases that allow visitors to explore individual capabilities in depth, understand their specific value propositions, and see how they apply to different industries and use cases. Each capability page maintains the established C9d.ai brand identity with vibrant color palette (purple-pink gradients, electric blue, teal accents, and bright yellow-lime) and gentle floating animations while providing comprehensive information about features, use cases, technical specifications, and integration options. The pages are designed to convert visitors from general interest to capability-specific engagement through targeted calls-to-action and industry-relevant examples.
