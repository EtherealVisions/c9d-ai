# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature modernizes the project's infrastructure by integrating Phase.dev for secure environment variable management, preparing for Vercel deployments, implementing a monorepo structure using Turbo, and standardizing on pnpm as the dependency manager. This will improve security, scalability, and development workflow efficiency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Phase.dev for environment variable management, so that I can securely manage secrets and configuration across different environments without exposing sensitive data in code repositories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL retrieve environment variables from Phase.dev using a PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN
2. WHEN PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN is provided in environment or .env.* files THEN the system SHALL authenticate with Phase.dev using the app name 'AI.C9d.Web'
3. WHEN Phase.dev is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback gracefully to local environment variables
4. WHEN environment variables are retrieved THEN the system SHALL cache them appropriately for performance
5. IF Phase.dev authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages and use fallback configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the application prepared for Vercel deployments, so that I can deploy the application seamlessly to Vercel's platform with proper configuration and optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to Vercel THEN the system SHALL have proper build configuration for Next.js optimization
2. WHEN Vercel builds the application THEN the system SHALL properly handle environment variables from Phase.dev
3. WHEN deployed on Vercel THEN the system SHALL have appropriate serverless function configurations
4. WHEN using Vercel THEN the system SHALL have proper static file handling and caching strategies
5. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a monorepo structure using Turbo, so that I can manage multiple related packages efficiently with shared dependencies and coordinated build processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is restructured THEN the system SHALL organize code into logical packages within a monorepo
2. WHEN building the project THEN Turbo SHALL orchestrate builds across all packages efficiently
3. WHEN dependencies change THEN the system SHALL properly manage shared dependencies across packages
4. WHEN running scripts THEN Turbo SHALL execute tasks in the correct order based on dependencies
5. IF a package build fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about which package and why

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use pnpm as the dependency manager, so that I can benefit from faster installs, better disk space efficiency, and improved dependency resolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use pnpm instead of npm or yarn
2. WHEN managing workspaces THEN pnpm SHALL handle monorepo package linking correctly
3. WHEN resolving dependencies THEN pnpm SHALL ensure consistent versions across the monorepo
4. WHEN caching dependencies THEN pnpm SHALL optimize storage and installation speed
5. IF dependency conflicts occur THEN pnpm SHALL provide clear resolution guidance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration between all infrastructure components, so that Phase.dev, Vercel, Turbo, and pnpm work together without conflicts or configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using all components together THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent configuration across Phase.dev, Vercel, Turbo, and pnpm
2. WHEN building for Vercel THEN Turbo SHALL properly coordinate the build process using pnpm
3. WHEN deploying THEN Phase.dev environment variables SHALL be accessible in the Vercel environment
4. WHEN developing locally THEN all tools SHALL work together seamlessly
5. IF integration issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information to identify the problem source
