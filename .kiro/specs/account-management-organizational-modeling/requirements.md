# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Account Management & Organizational Modeling feature provides the foundational user and organization structure for the C9d.ai platform. This system enables both individual users and teams to access the platform with appropriate permissions, role-based access controls, and organizational context that determines feature access, agent permissions, and dataset visibility. The system supports complex organizational structures where individuals can belong to multiple organizations while maintaining clear tenant isolation and security boundaries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to create and manage individual accounts, so that I can access C9d.ai services with my personal identity and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL create an individual account with unique identifier
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate using Clerk (or compatible auth provider)
3. WHEN a user accesses their profile THEN the system SHALL display account information, preferences, and settings
4. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN the system SHALL validate and persist the changes
5. IF a user attempts to register with existing email THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate account creation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to create and manage organizational accounts, so that my team can collaborate on C9d.ai with shared resources and permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authorized user creates an organization THEN the system SHALL establish a new tenant with unique identifier
2. WHEN an organization is created THEN the system SHALL assign the creator as the initial administrator
3. WHEN viewing organization details THEN the system SHALL display organization metadata, settings, and member list
4. WHEN an organization is updated THEN the system SHALL validate changes and maintain audit trail
5. IF organization name conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL enforce unique naming within the platform

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to belong to multiple organizations, so that I can work across different teams and projects while maintaining separate contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is invited to an organization THEN the system SHALL allow membership without affecting existing memberships
2. WHEN a user switches between organizations THEN the system SHALL update the active organizational context
3. WHEN a user accesses resources THEN the system SHALL filter based on current organizational context
4. WHEN a user leaves an organization THEN the system SHALL revoke access to organization-specific resources
5. IF a user has no active organization selected THEN the system SHALL default to individual account context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an organization administrator, I want to manage user roles and permissions, so that I can control access to features, agents, and datasets based on team member responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator assigns a role THEN the system SHALL apply corresponding permissions immediately
2. WHEN a user's role changes THEN the system SHALL update access controls across all platform features
3. WHEN viewing permissions THEN the system SHALL display current roles and associated capabilities
4. WHEN a role is removed THEN the system SHALL revoke all associated permissions and access
5. IF role conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL apply the most restrictive permissions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to implement tenant-specific metadata and isolation, so that organizational data and configurations remain secure and separate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing organizational resources THEN the system SHALL enforce tenant-level data isolation
2. WHEN storing organizational metadata THEN the system SHALL associate data with correct tenant identifier
3. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL filter results based on tenant context
4. WHEN a user switches organizations THEN the system SHALL prevent cross-tenant data access
5. IF tenant boundaries are violated THEN the system SHALL log security events and deny access

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want role-based access control (RBAC) integrated with authentication, so that my permissions are automatically applied based on my organizational roles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the system SHALL load all associated roles and permissions
2. WHEN accessing protected resources THEN the system SHALL verify permissions against user's current role
3. WHEN permissions are insufficient THEN the system SHALL deny access with appropriate error message
4. WHEN roles are updated THEN the system SHALL refresh user permissions without requiring re-authentication
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL prevent all access to protected resources

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an organization member, I want my organizational context to determine my access to agents and datasets, so that I can work with the appropriate resources for my current role and organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing agents THEN the system SHALL show only agents available to current organization
2. WHEN accessing datasets THEN the system SHALL filter based on organizational permissions
3. WHEN creating resources THEN the system SHALL associate them with current organizational context
4. WHEN switching organizations THEN the system SHALL update available agents and datasets
5. IF organizational access is revoked THEN the system SHALL immediately restrict resource access

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive audit logging for account and organizational activities, so that I can monitor security, compliance, and usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users perform account actions THEN the system SHALL log all authentication and profile changes
2. WHEN organizational changes occur THEN the system SHALL record membership, role, and permission modifications
3. WHEN accessing audit logs THEN the system SHALL provide searchable, filterable activity history
4. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and detailed log entries
5. IF audit logging fails THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and maintain service availability
