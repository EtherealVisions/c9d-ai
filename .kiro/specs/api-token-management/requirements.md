# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The API Token Management feature provides a comprehensive system for creating, managing, and securing API tokens that enable programmatic access to C9d.ai services. The system supports both individual-bound tokens for developer access and service account tokens for CI/CD and integration scenarios. It includes granular scope assignment, rate limiting, usage tracking, and administrative controls with a focus on security, delegation, and operational visibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create and manage API tokens with specific scopes and permissions, so that I can integrate C9d.ai services into my applications with appropriate access controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating an API token THEN the system SHALL generate a unique, cryptographically secure token with configurable expiration
2. WHEN assigning token scopes THEN the system SHALL provide granular permissions for read/write access, agent access, and specific endpoints
3. WHEN viewing token details THEN the system SHALL display creator, creation date, last usage, scopes, and IP history
4. WHEN copying a token THEN the system SHALL provide secure copy functionality with regeneration options
5. IF token creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and validation feedback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an organization administrator, I want to manage API tokens for my team members, so that I can control access, monitor usage, and maintain security across organizational integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing organization tokens THEN the system SHALL display all tokens created by team members with appropriate visibility controls
2. WHEN managing team tokens THEN the system SHALL allow administrators to revoke, rotate, or modify token permissions
3. WHEN assigning token policies THEN the system SHALL enable RBAC-based token access controls
4. WHEN monitoring token usage THEN the system SHALL provide traffic patterns and usage analytics per token
5. IF security concerns arise THEN the system SHALL support emergency kill-switch for all organizational tokens

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want to create service account tokens for automated systems, so that I can enable CI/CD pipelines and integration workflows without user-specific credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating service account tokens THEN the system SHALL support long-lived tokens with appropriate security controls
2. WHEN configuring service tokens THEN the system SHALL allow assignment to specific services or integration scenarios
3. WHEN managing service tokens THEN the system SHALL provide rotation capabilities without service interruption
4. WHEN monitoring service usage THEN the system SHALL track automated system access patterns and anomalies
5. IF service tokens are compromised THEN the system SHALL enable immediate revocation and replacement

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want token-level rate limiting and usage controls, so that my API access is managed according to my subscription plan and usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using API tokens THEN the system SHALL enforce rate limits inherited from subscription plan tiers
2. WHEN exceeding rate limits THEN the system SHALL provide clear error responses with reset timing information
3. WHEN configuring token limits THEN the system SHALL allow override of default limits based on specific use cases
4. WHEN approaching quota limits THEN the system SHALL send warnings and usage notifications
5. IF rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL log events and provide usage analytics for optimization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive token security controls and audit logging, so that I can maintain security compliance and monitor for unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tokens are created or modified THEN the system SHALL log all security-relevant events with full audit trail
2. WHEN detecting suspicious activity THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and optionally suspend tokens
3. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically revoke access and notify token owners
4. WHEN reviewing security logs THEN the system SHALL provide searchable audit history with IP tracking and usage patterns
5. IF security violations occur THEN the system SHALL implement automatic response protocols and incident logging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an intuitive token management UI with guided workflows, so that I can easily create, configure, and manage tokens without security mistakes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating tokens THEN the system SHALL provide guided creation flows with recommended scopes and use cases
2. WHEN viewing token summaries THEN the system SHALL display readable information with quick copy and regenerate options
3. WHEN filtering tokens THEN the system SHALL support team-based filtering, tagging, and search capabilities
4. WHEN managing token lifecycle THEN the system SHALL provide clear warnings for expiration and quota exhaustion
5. IF tokens need attention THEN the system SHALL provide visual insights and actionable recommendations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want tokens to provide access to agent creation and management, so that I can programmatically create and configure agents through the API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using agent-scoped tokens THEN the system SHALL allow creation of new agents via REST API
2. WHEN managing agents THEN the system SHALL support GET/POST/PUT/DELETE operations on agent resources
3. WHEN configuring agents THEN the system SHALL enable setting name, description, persona, input/output schema, and trigger modes
4. WHEN accessing agent logs THEN the system SHALL provide execution history and performance metrics
5. IF token scopes are insufficient THEN the system SHALL deny agent operations with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want token usage analytics and monitoring, so that I can understand API consumption patterns and optimize platform performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing token usage THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on calls, errors, latencies, and endpoint patterns
2. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track agent pipeline performance and model selection patterns
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL support exportable analytics in CSV and JSON formats
4. WHEN detecting anomalies THEN the system SHALL alert on unusual usage patterns or potential security issues
5. IF performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want token access controls integrated with organizational permissions, so that token capabilities align with user roles and organizational security policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assigning token permissions THEN the system SHALL respect organizational RBAC policies and user roles
2. WHEN users change roles THEN the system SHALL automatically update token permissions to match new access levels
3. WHEN reviewing token access THEN the system SHALL provide visibility into permission inheritance and overrides
4. WHEN enforcing policies THEN the system SHALL prevent token creation that exceeds user's organizational permissions
5. IF permission conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL apply most restrictive permissions and log policy violations
