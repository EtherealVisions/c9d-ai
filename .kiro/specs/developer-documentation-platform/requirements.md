# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Developer Documentation Platform provides a comprehensive Docusaurus-powered documentation system that serves both internal engineering teams and external developers. The platform hosts multiple documentation types including internal architecture documentation, external SDK and API documentation, feature flag definitions, team onboarding guides, and versioned release notes. The system integrates with GitHub and Linear for automated FRD/PRD publishing and maintains synchronized documentation across development workflows.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want feature flag documentation and management, so that I can understand and control feature rollouts across the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing feature flags THEN the system SHALL display current flag status, target audiences, and rollout percentages
2. WHEN managing flags THEN the system SHALL provide flag descriptions, dependencies, and impact assessments
3. WHEN flags change THEN the system SHALL log changes and notify affected teams with rollback procedures
4. WHEN planning releases THEN the system SHALL show flag dependencies and recommended rollout sequences
