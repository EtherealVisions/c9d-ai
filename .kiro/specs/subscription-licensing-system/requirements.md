## Introduction

The Subscription & Licensing System provides a premium, usage-gated product model for C9d.ai with no free tier. The system manages tiered subscription plans (Individual, Team, Enterprise) with configurable feature gates, licensing identifiers, and usage quotas. It integrates with Stripe for billing and provides comprehensive usage tracking, quota enforcement, and plan management capabilities aligned with the organizational modeling system.
