# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The C9D SDK Client provides a comprehensive JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for integrating with the C9d.ai platform, supporting both Node.js server environments and Edge runtime environments (Vercel Edge Functions, Cloudflare Workers, etc.). The SDK offers a developer-friendly interface for agent management, execution, authentication, and platform features while maintaining high performance, type safety, and excellent developer experience. The SDK abstracts the complexity of the underlying APIs while providing full access to platform capabilities.

1. WHEN running in Edge environments THEN the system SHALL provide full functionality without Node.js-specific dependencies
2. WHEN executing in Edge runtime THEN the system SHALL maintain minimal bundle size and fast cold start performance
3. WHEN handling requests THEN the system SHALL support streaming responses and real-time agent execution monitoring
4. WHEN managing resources THEN the system SHALL efficiently handle memory and execution time constraints of Edge environments
5. IF Edge limitations are encountered THEN the system SHALL provide graceful fallbacks and clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive authentication and authorization support in the SDK, so that I can securely access C9d.ai services with proper token management and automatic renewal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authenticating THEN the system SHALL support API tokens, OAuth flows, and service account authentication methods
2. WHEN managing tokens THEN the system SHALL automatically handle token refresh, expiration, and secure storage
3. WHEN making requests THEN the system SHALL automatically include proper authentication headers and handle authentication errors
4. WHEN working with organizations THEN the system SHALL support organizational context switching and role-based access
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and guidance for resolution

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want full agent lifecycle management through the SDK, so that I can create, configure, execute, and monitor AI agents programmatically with a clean, intuitive API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing agents THEN the system SHALL provide CRUD operations with validation, error handling, and type safety
2. WHEN executing agents THEN the system SHALL support synchronous and asynchronous execution with real-time progress monitoring
3. WHEN configuring agents THEN the system SHALL offer schema validation, dependency checking, and configuration templates
4. WHEN monitoring execution THEN the system SHALL provide streaming logs, metrics, and execution status updates
5. IF execution fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information, retry mechanisms, and debugging support

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient caching and performance optimization in the SDK, so that my applications can achieve optimal performance while minimizing API calls and latency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making repeated requests THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching with configurable TTL and cache invalidation
2. WHEN handling large datasets THEN the system SHALL support pagination, lazy loading, and efficient data streaming
3. WHEN executing multiple operations THEN the system SHALL provide request batching and parallel execution capabilities
4. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL minimize bundle size and support tree-shaking for unused features
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide performance monitoring and optimization recommendations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and debugging support, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues when integrating with the C9d.ai platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error objects with error codes, messages, and contextual information
2. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL offer configurable logging levels and detailed request/response logging
3. WHEN handling failures THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry logic with exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic tools and health check capabilities
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms and graceful degradation options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time capabilities and streaming support, so that I can build responsive applications that react to agent execution progress and platform events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring execution THEN the system SHALL provide real-time streaming of agent execution logs and progress updates
2. WHEN handling events THEN the system SHALL support WebSocket connections and Server-Sent Events for real-time notifications
3. WHEN processing streams THEN the system SHALL offer efficient stream processing with backpressure handling and error recovery
4. WHEN managing connections THEN the system SHALL automatically handle connection lifecycle, reconnection, and heartbeat management
5. IF streaming fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback polling mechanisms and connection recovery strategies

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want plugin and extension support in the SDK, so that I can customize functionality and integrate with third-party services and frameworks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extending functionality THEN the system SHALL provide a plugin architecture with hooks and middleware support
2. WHEN integrating frameworks THEN the system SHALL offer pre-built integrations for popular frameworks like Next.js, Express, and Fastify
3. WHEN customizing behavior THEN the system SHALL support custom interceptors, transformers, and response handlers
4. WHEN adding features THEN the system SHALL provide extension points for custom authentication, caching, and logging implementations
5. IF plugins conflict THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution and plugin management capabilities

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing utilities and mocking support, so that I can thoroughly test my applications that integrate with C9d.ai without requiring live API access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN the system SHALL provide mock implementations of all SDK methods with configurable responses
