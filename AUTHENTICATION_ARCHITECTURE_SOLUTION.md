# Authentication Architecture Solution

## Current Issue

The authentication flow is failing because:

1. **Database Connection Requirement**: The repository pattern currently uses Drizzle ORM which requires a direct PostgreSQL connection
2. **Service Role Key Dependency**: The PostgreSQL connection requires `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
3. **API Route Limitations**: We removed the requirement for `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` from the middleware for `/api/auth/me`, but the repository still needs it
4. **Client-Server Boundary**: We correctly identified that database access should never happen from the browser

## Architectural Conflict

There are two database access patterns in the codebase:

1. **Drizzle ORM Pattern** (in `/lib/db/connection.ts`):
   - Uses direct PostgreSQL connection
   - Requires `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - Used by repository pattern in `/lib/repositories`

2. **TypedSupabaseClient Pattern** (in `/lib/models/database.ts`):
   - Uses Supabase JavaScript client
   - Only requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - Properly handles RLS (Row Level Security)
   - Suitable for API routes without service role key

## The Correct Solution

Following the well-established patterns and [Clerk's Next.js documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/nextjs/overview):

1. **Use `auth()` in API routes** to get the authenticated user's ID
2. **Use `currentUser()` in API routes** to get full user details from Clerk
3. **Use TypedSupabaseClient** for database operations in API routes (not Drizzle)
4. **Maintain proper separation** between client and server code

## Implementation Steps

1. **Update Repository Factory**:
   - Create a new repository implementation that uses `TypedSupabaseClient`
   - Use this for API routes that don't have service role key access

2. **Fix `/api/auth/me` Route**:
   - Continue using `auth()` and `currentUser()` from Clerk
   - Use TypedSupabaseClient-based repositories for database operations

3. **Maintain Security**:
   - Never expose service role key to client-side code
   - Always validate authentication on the server
   - Use RLS policies in Supabase for additional security

## Key Principles

1. **No Direct Database Access from Browser**: All database operations must go through API routes
2. **Use Appropriate Database Client**: TypedSupabaseClient for API routes, Drizzle for admin/service operations
3. **Follow Clerk Patterns**: Use their server-side helpers (`auth()`, `currentUser()`) as documented
4. **Respect Environment Boundaries**: Different database access patterns for different contexts

## Next Steps

The immediate fix is to update the repository pattern to support both Drizzle (for admin operations with service role key) and TypedSupabaseClient (for regular API operations with anon key). This maintains security while allowing the authentication flow to work properly.
