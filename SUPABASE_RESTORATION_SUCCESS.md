# Supabase Restoration Success

## Summary

The application is now working correctly after Supabase instance restoration!

## What's Working

### ✅ Database Connection
- **No more ECONNREFUSED errors**
- Database URL from Phase.dev is connecting successfully to Supabase
- Connection string: `postgresql://...@aws-1-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true`

### ✅ Authentication Flow
- API endpoint `/api/auth/me` correctly requires authentication
- Unauthenticated requests are properly redirected to `/sign-in`
- Clerk integration is working with proper middleware

### ✅ Phase.dev Integration
- All 27 secrets loaded successfully
- DATABASE_URL is properly loaded when using `pnpm turbo dev`
- Environment variables are correctly injected via `env-wrapper`

## Key Commands

### Start Development Server
```bash
pnpm turbo dev
```

### Test Environment Variables
```bash
cd apps/web
../../node_modules/.bin/env-wrapper node ../../scripts/print-database-url.js
```

## Current Status

The application is functioning as expected:
1. Database connection through Supabase pooler is active
2. Authentication middleware properly protects API routes
3. Phase.dev secrets are loading correctly
4. The development environment is fully operational

## Notes

- The Supabase instance pause was the root cause of the ECONNREFUSED errors
- Using `pnpm` and `turbo` commands ensures proper environment variable loading through `env-wrapper`
- The DATABASE_URL from Phase.dev is correctly formatted and working
