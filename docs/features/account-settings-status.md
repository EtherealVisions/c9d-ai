### Database Schema

Planned database improvements:

```sql
-- Enhanced user preferences table
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  theme VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'system',
  language VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'en',
  timezone VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'UTC',
  email_notifications JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  privacy_settings JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  accessibility_settings JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Security audit log
CREATE TABLE security_audit_log (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  action VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  ip_address INET,
  user_agent TEXT,
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
