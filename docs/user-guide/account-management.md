- `organization.delete`: Delete the organization

Organizations can create custom roles with specific permission sets:

#### Managing Custom Roles

⚠️ **Note**: Changing role permissions affects all members with that role immediately.

### Permission Inheritance

Permissions follow a hierarchical structure:

Custom roles can have any combination of permissions, regardless of hierarchy.
