## Migration Guide

### For Existing Components

When updating existing components to use the new design system:

1. **Replace hardcoded colors** with design tokens:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   const style = { color: '#7B2CBF' }
   
   // After  
   import { brandColors } from '@/lib/design-system/tokens'
   const style = { color: brandColors.primary.purple.vibrant }
   ```

2. **Update spacing** to use the spacing scale:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   const style = { padding: '1rem 2rem' }
   
   // After
   import { spacing } from '@/lib/design-system/tokens'
   const style = { padding: `${spacing[4]} ${spacing[8]}` }
   ```

3. **Apply typography tokens** for consistent text styling:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   const style = { fontSize: '1.5rem', fontWeight: '600' }
   
   // After
   import { typography } from '@/lib/design-system/tokens'
   const style = { 
     fontSize: typography.fontSize['2xl'][0],
     fontWeight: typography.fontWeight.semibold
   }
   ```
