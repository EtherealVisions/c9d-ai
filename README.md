## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application uses a hybrid approach for environment management:

1. **Phase.dev** (Recommended): Secure, centralized configuration
2. **Local .env files**: Development and fallback
3. **Platform variables**: Direct deployment configuration

Key variables:
- `PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN` - Phase.dev service token
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Clerk authentication
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - Clerk server-side key

See [Environment Setup Guide](docs/environment-setup.md) for complete configuration details.

### Package Management

This project uses **pnpm** for efficient dependency management:

- **Faster installs**: Up to 2x faster than npm/yarn
- **Disk efficient**: Shared dependency storage
- **Strict resolution**: Prevents phantom dependencies
- **Monorepo support**: Built-in workspace management

### Build System

**Turbo** orchestrates builds across the monorepo:

- **Incremental builds**: Only rebuilds changed packages
- **Parallel execution**: Runs tasks simultaneously
- **Intelligent caching**: Caches outputs and test results
- **Task dependencies**: Ensures correct build order

## üöÄ Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

The application is optimized for Vercel deployment:

1. **Connect repository** to Vercel
2. **Set environment variables** in Vercel dashboard:
   - `PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN` (required)
   - Other variables as needed
3. **Deploy** - Vercel automatically uses optimized build process

### Other Platforms

For other deployment platforms:

1. Set `PHASE_SERVICE_TOKEN` environment variable
2. Use build command: `pnpm build`
3. Serve the `apps/web/.next` directory

See [Vercel Deployment Guide](docs/vercel-deployment.md) for detailed instructions.

## üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance

The project follows comprehensive testing standards with unit, integration, and E2E tests. All tests are designed for isolation and parallel execution with advanced coverage tracking and quality gates.

**Note**: The project is currently in active development. Some TypeScript compilation errors exist and are being resolved as part of ongoing development work. The analytics type system has been added and documented, but integration with existing services is in progress.

### Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run all tests once (default behavior)
pnpm test

# Run tests once (explicit)
pnpm test:run

# Watch mode for development (explicit)
pnpm test:dev

# Alternative watch mode command
pnpm test:watch

# Specific package tests (run once)
pnpm test --filter=@c9d/web

# Run with coverage reporting
pnpm test:coverage

# Unit tests only
pnpm test:unit

# Integration tests
pnpm test:integration

# E2E tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Performance tests
pnpm test:performance
```

### Quality Validation Commands

```bash
# Quick validation (typecheck + lint)
pnpm validate:quick

# Full validation (typecheck + lint + test:coverage + build)
pnpm validate:full

# Coverage validation with detailed reporting
pnpm validate:coverage

# Complete task validation with all quality gates
pnpm validate:task-completion
```

### Coverage Analysis Commands

```bash
# Generate detailed coverage analysis and recommendations
pnpm coverage:report

# Open interactive HTML coverage report
pnpm coverage:open

# Generate machine-readable coverage formats
pnpm coverage:json         # JSON format
pnpm coverage:lcov         # LCOV format for CI/CD
```

### Test Standards & Coverage Requirements

- **100% Test Success Rate**: All tests must pass without skips or failures
- **Tiered Coverage Requirements**: Module-specific coverage thresholds based on criticality
  - **Global Minimum**: 85% (branches, functions, lines, statements)
  - **Services (`lib/services/**`)**: 100% coverage required (critical business logic)
  - **Models (`lib/models/**`)**: 95% coverage required (data layer)
  - **API Routes (`app/api/**`)**: 90% coverage required (external interfaces)
- **Test Isolation**: Each test runs independently with proper cleanup
- **Performance Aware**: Tests execute efficiently with parallel execution (max 4 threads)
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Multiple coverage formats (HTML, JSON, LCOV, console)

### Coverage Reports

Coverage reports are generated in multiple formats:
- **Interactive HTML**: `./coverage/index.html` - Line-by-line coverage visualization
- **JSON Summary**: `./coverage/coverage-summary.json` - Quick statistics
- **LCOV**: `./coverage/lcov.info` - CI/CD integration format
- **Test Results**: `./test-results/` - Detailed test execution reports

## üîç Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Environment variables not loading**: Check `.env.local` format and location
- **pnpm command not found**: Install with `npm install -g pnpm`
- **Build failures**: Clear cache with `rm -rf .turbo/cache && pnpm build`
- **Database connection**: Verify `DATABASE_URL` format and credentials
- **Authentication issues**: Check Clerk keys and configuration

See [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting.md) for comprehensive solutions.
